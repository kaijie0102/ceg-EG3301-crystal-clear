Wine Glass Cleaning Machine -- Integrating mechanical, electrical, software and plumbing

We are working under NUS's EG3301R, a one year module for students to bring ideas to proof-of-concept. In our project, we are collaborating with Wine Portal, our industrial partner, to create a wine glass washer and polisher machine, bringing you a hassle free wine drinking experience.
